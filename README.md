### Tumor-Segmentation-in-Multimodal-Brain-MRI-Uisng-DeepLearnig
This repo is targeting the brain tumor segmentation challenge.
There are multiple files uploaded in the drive and all the data is preprocessd and models are trained. 
- Step-01:
	Import all the required folders into the google drive.

- Step-02:
	There are some directory names and verify it according to it. 
	- 'LGG',
 	- 'HGG',
 	- 'survival_data.csv',
 	- 'Model_logs',
 	- 'Training Data',
 	- 'Test Data',
 	- 'Validation Data',
 	- 'Extracted Data',
 	- 'Saved Models ',
 	- 'Miscellaneous ',
 	- 'Model Checkpoints',
 	- 'unet.png',
 	- 'Proposed_System.ipynb'
- Step-03:
	Open the 'Main_file.ipynb' using Google Colaboratory and execute each cell of this file , as all the code are saved in this file.
	There are trained models and prepared dataset which you can now use.
- Step-04:
	Restart the Google Colaboratory Runtime and sete to GPu or TPu to get the maximum execution in short time. 

- Use the trained models and prepaired dataset BRATS 2018 from the given my drive link:
